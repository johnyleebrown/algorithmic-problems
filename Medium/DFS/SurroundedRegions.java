 *
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O),
 * capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
 *
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in
 * that surrounded region.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * X X X X
 * X O O X
 * X X O X
 * X O X X
 *
 * After running your function, the board should be:
 *
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X O X X
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which
 * means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not
 * flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and
 * it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be
 * flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are
 * adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
 *
 *
 * Similar Idea:
 * {@link NumberofIslands}, {@link MaxAreaOfIsland}

     * Idea:
     * Use 3rd character (or color).
     * Go around perimeter and get all perimeter-connected cells and color them into 3rd color;
     * So all not needed cells will be colored in 3rd color.
     * In the last loop we color O -> X and 3rd color -> O

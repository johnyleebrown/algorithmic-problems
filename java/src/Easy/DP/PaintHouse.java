 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted

 * cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.
 * You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent
 * houses have the same color. The cost of painting each house
 * with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with
 * color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with

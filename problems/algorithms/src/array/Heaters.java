 * 475
 * Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
 * Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.
 * So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.
 *
 * Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
 * Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
 * As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
 * All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.

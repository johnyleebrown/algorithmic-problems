/**
 * 1303C
 *
 * ======
 *
 * Task.
 *
 * Polycarp wants to assemble his own keyboard. Layouts with multiple rows are
 * too complicated for him ‚Äî his keyboard will consist of only one row, where
 * all 26
 *
 * lowercase Latin letters will be arranged in some order.
 *
 * Polycarp uses the same password ùë† on all websites where he is registered (it
 * is bad, but he doesn't care). He wants to assemble a keyboard that will allow
 * to type this password very easily. He doesn't like to move his fingers while
 * typing the password, so, for each pair of adjacent characters in ùë†, they
 * should be adjacent on the keyboard. For example, if the password is abacaba,
 * then the layout cabdefghi... is perfect, since characters a and c are
 * adjacent on the keyboard, and a and b are adjacent on the keyboard. It is
 * guaranteed that there are no two adjacent equal characters in ùë†
 *
 * , so, for example, the password cannot be password (two characters s are
 * adjacent).
 *
 * Can you help Polycarp with choosing the perfect layout of the keyboard, if it
 * is possible?

Examples:
- parse string into expression tree
- parse string to convert - implement a library that converts amongst the following 3 colour formats:
    * RGB, e.g. (20, 200, 100) where each integer is between 0-255
    * Floating Point, e.g. (0.023213F, 0.0322376F, 0.7628F) where each float number is between 0-1
    * Hex, e.g. "#14C8F3"

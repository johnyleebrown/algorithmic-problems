 *
 * Task.
 *
 * There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
 *
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to
 * its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 *
 * Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the
 * clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
 * Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
 * Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
